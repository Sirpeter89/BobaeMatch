## What is BobaeMatch?

Bobae match is a dating application based on user's personal boba interests. It is a fullstack web application that allows users to find significant others or friends according to their boba tastes.

The matching algorithm starts off by finding users who like similar teas, if less than 5 users are matched we start moving on to addons, if there's still less than 5 then we move onto sugar levels, whether they like fruit teas and so forth.

## Technologies Used

Bobae Match uses a backend built with Python, SQLAlchemy, and Flask. The front end uses React, Javascript, and Redux.
